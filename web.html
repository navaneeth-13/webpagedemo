    <p> Software testing is the process of evaluating a software application to ensure it works correctly, meets user requirements, and is free from defects. It helps identify errors, gaps, or missing requirements compared to the actual output.
The main goal of software testing is to improve quality, reliability, and performance before release. It can be done manually or through automation tools.</p>
